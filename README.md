*to create in 5 min's a refugee city map*


## Name: Come On

An app that helps people on their way while they’re fleeing. It includes
everything. Maps, info points, where to go when you arrive to a new city.
There’s a lot of false information out there - in German you can’t be send away
for medical issues, but people still get sent away.

It should also be a guide for people that are about to come to a new country. It
could cover topics like length of stays, returns. All the information will be
open so volunteers can edit and add other destinations and routes.
